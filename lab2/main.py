 Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year€™s Eve Message; 
 This is Disturbing,"Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans a Happy New Year and leave it at that. 
 Instead, he had to give a shout out to his enemies, haters and  the very dishonest fake news media.  
 The former reality show star had just one job to do and he couldn t do it. 
 As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, 
 and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year,  President Angry Pants tweeted.  
 2018 will be a great year for America!'''
